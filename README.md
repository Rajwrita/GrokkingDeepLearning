# GrokkingDeepLearning
This repository will contain my take on `Andrew Trask's` book `GrokkingDeepLearning`.

## The way you should go about fidgeting the repository:
1. Forward Propagation
2. Gradient Descent (which also takes into account the learning concept in the neural network)
3. Generalizing Gradient Descent
4. MNIST dataset with `weight` visualization
5. MNIST dataset with `weight` visualization using `Keras`
6. StreetLight Problem, introducing the concept of input to output correlation
7. Streetlight Problem, making an intermediate layer for a Deep Neural Network.
