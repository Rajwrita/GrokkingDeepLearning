# GrokkingDeepLearning
This repository will contain my take on `Andrew Trask's` book `GrokkingDeepLearning`.

## The way you should go about fidgeting the repository:
* Forward Propagation
* Gradient Descent (which also takes into account the learning concept in the neural network)
* Generalizing Gradient Descent
